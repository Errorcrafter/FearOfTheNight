This datapack is still in an extremely early beta and may be prone to bugs. As such, this is probably is not safe to use on a multiplayer server. If you want to use it anyway, please make sure to give me credit.

- 12 custom mobs
- 4(+1) custom bosses
- Custom crafting machine
- A bunch of other stuff we haven't thought of or implemented yet

## Dependencies
[TBA]

## Installation
***THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY BE PRONE TO CHANGE.***

Go to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Errorcrafter/fotn/releases) and click on the Assets dropdown. From there, click the `Source code (zip)` link to download fotn Pack. Use WinRAR or a similar program to unzip the folder. Place the resulting folder in the following directory:

- **Singleplayer:** `.minecraft/saves/(your world name here)/datapacks`

Once you've done that, go ingame and type `/reload` (or, if you use Minehut, `/minecraft:reload`). You're done!

## Contributing and Usage
If for some reason you want to ruin your GitHub stats just open a PR and I'll merge it if it's good.
This project uses the [GPLv2](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) license, meaning you must give us credit and open source any edits you make. This especially applies to anyone in the TeamPrim and Secreted servers, since I know those braindead fags who can't even use WinRAR will skid from this and sell it for five dollars. Watch a fucking tutorial you jew.
