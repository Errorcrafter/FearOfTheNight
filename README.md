<p>
Huge datapack with custom bosses, mobs, items and completely new quest lines!
</p>

---

## Important Note
This datapack is still in an extremely early beta and may be prone to bugs. As such, this is probably is not safe to use on a multiplayer server. If you want to use it anyway, please make sure to give me credit.

## Features
- 16 custom items
- 12 custom mobs
- 4(+1) custom bosses
- Custom crafting machine
- A bunch of other stuff we haven't thought of or implemented yet

## Dependencies
[TBA]

## Installation
***THESE INSTRUCTIONS MAY BE PRONE TO CHANGE.***

Go to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Errorcrafter/fotn/releases) and click on the Assets dropdown. From there, follow these steps:


1. Download `NightVisionv3b3.zip` and `FearOfTheNight-v1.3.1Beta.zip`.
2. Use your archiver of choice to unzip them.
3. Inside the archives there will be a single folder that contains all the stuff that you need. Drag the folder out of your downloads folder. (dont ask why they probably have the wrong names icba to rename them after the rebrand lol)
4. Drag the folder you got out of `FearOfTheNight-v1.3.1Beta.zip` into the datapack folder of your world/server, and drag the folder from `NightVisionv3b3.zip` into your resource pack folder.

If these steps somehow still break, I may not be able to help you because for some retarded reason WinRAR and Windows' built in ZIP archiver both make these subfolders. I have no idea why, and I don't know how to fix it. **TLDR: unzip, there will be a folder inside the zip, use that folder.**

This project uses the [GPLv2](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) license, meaning you must give us credit and open source any edits you make. This especially applies to anyone in the TeamPrim and Secreted servers, since I know those braindead fags who can't even use WinRAR will skid from this and sell it for five dollars. Watch a fucking tutorial you jew.
